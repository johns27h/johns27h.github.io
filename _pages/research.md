At Mount Holyoke College, I conducted quantitative research on access to reproductive health education in the United States. This research culminated in my [undergraduate honors thesis](https://ida.mtholyoke.edu/handle/10166/5692), completed under the supervision of Dr. Timothy Malacarne. The thesis earned high honors in the Mount Holyoke College Sociology Department. For more information, please [contact me](https://www.heatherajohnston.com/contact/).
